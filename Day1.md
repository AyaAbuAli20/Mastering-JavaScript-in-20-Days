# Day 1: Basic JavaScripts

## Lesson Summary

### Introduction 
I learned the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is the noun, CSS is the adjective, and JavaScript is the verb in terms of website interactions and animations. I also learned about the different places where JavaScript can be written, such as the browser's JavaScript console, local text files in editors, and online playgrounds.

### DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document. Every HTML element is an object, and through the DOM, we can access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. We can get, change, add, or delete elements.

### Values & Data Types
There are two kinds of data: primitive types (e.g., strings, numbers) and objects (e.g., `document` and related objects). We went deeper into strings and learned about methods like `length`, `includes`, `toLowerCase`, `startsWith`, and `indexOf`.

### Operators
We learned about arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and the order of operations.

#### My Solution

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5; // The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
